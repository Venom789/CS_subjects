# What is a Proposition?
Any statement that is either true or false, is termed as proposition.

There are two laws regarding proposition as follows:
#### 1. Law of excluded middle
This law states that a proposition is required to be either true or false but not both.

#### 2. Law of contradiction
```
True = not False
False = not True
```

## Types of proposition:

#### - Atomic Proposition
Any proposition which cannot be further divded is termed as atomic proposition.

#### - Compund Proposition
One or more atomic proposition combined to form a compound proposition using **connectors/operators** (i.e ~, ^, v, ->, <->).

**Note**:- `Both atomic and compund Proposition's are generally termed as Premises`.

## What is Argument?
Collection of Premises on the basis of which we derive a conclusion is termed as Arguement.
